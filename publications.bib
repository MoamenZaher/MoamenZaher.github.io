  abstract={System surveillance involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of organizational data to ensure security and operational efficiency. This proactive approach aids in detecting anomalies, threats, and performance issues, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining system integrity. This paper proposes a framework for querying videos named Referring Video Object Clustering (RVOC). Traditional methods necessitate identifying the number of clusters before object identification based on pre-trained datasets, with components such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) relying on fixed numerical values. In contrast, The proposed framework (RVOC) performs dynamic clustering without prior training, allowing the number of classes to adjust based on retrieved video objects. This method employs a sophisticated NLP query system, enabling intricate searches like “person skating on a red skateboard.” The system diligently searches and analyzes video content to find instances matching the query, grouping and segmenting detected individuals with advanced clustering algorithms. This enhances user experience by facilitating easy navigation and selection of desired individuals, with each cluster representing a unique person or object. RVOC's efficacy is evidenced by its Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score of 51% in tests with multilabel car and color datasets.},

Nurses hold a vital position in delivering care within hospital settings. It's crucial to anticipate stress levels among nurses to help them perform their duties effectively and avoid the long-term impacts of stress. This study seeks to explore how body sensors and machine learning techniques can be employed to monitor physiological signs and identify stress levels among nurses.

  abstract={Brain tumors are the leading cause of death world-wide. Deep learning has been successful in previous tasks like classification. However, it's being limited by the reliance on a single imaging modality which isn't enough, where a single modality can provide higher performance but is unreliable for accurate treatment and diagnosis. This study aims to improve brain tumor classification using deep learning and fusion techniques of multiple modalities. The study employs three fusion approaches: image-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and wavelet-based fusion. Extensive experiments were conducted on the BRATS2020 dataset. Initially, we train and evaluate the performance of 21 baseline models, encompassing 20 CNN-based architectures alongside the vision transformer model. Moreover, we identify the highest-performing models within each class for fusion. Furthermore, inspired by the baseline models, we dive deeper, introducing each modality as input to its respective best-performing model and fusing the outputs for multi-modality model-level fusion. Finally, we employ wavelet-based fusion to optimize information integration, implementing Discrete Wavelet Transform on our dataset. Model-level fusion outperformed image fusion across all evaluation metrics by 1 % accuracy, 4.7% precision, 6.6 % recall, and 0.7% F1-score.},

We conduct a comparative analysis of sixteen machine learning algorithms, categorized as ensemble and non-ensemble methods. Our findings demonstrate that ensemble models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting and Extra Trees, achieve superior performance in identifying CSRF attacks compared to non-ensemble models. We evaluate the models using 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, consistently revealing the superiority of ensemble approaches. Notably, our proposed Extra Tree classifier surpasses the state-of-the-art Random Forest algorithm by 2.67% in recall and 1.16% in F1-score.

  abstact={Rehabilitation is crucial for individuals recovering from injuries or illnesses. It combines medical knowledge, therapy, and technology to improve health and independence. However, a global shortage of physiotherapists makes it challenging to provide adequate rehabilitation services. Current rehabilitation research often lacks advanced computational techniques to automate exercise assessment, relying heavily on time-consuming and costly in-person sessions. This study uses computer vision and classical machine learning (ML) to monitor and evaluate physical rehabilitation exercises using skeletal data. It compares five feature extraction approaches, six feature ranking techniques, and thirteen ML algorithms to identify the most influential features for accurate exercise classification using benchmark datasets (UI-PRMD and KIMORE). The performances of feature ranking algorithms–X2, ReliefF, Gini Decrease, FCBF, Information Gain, and Information Gain Ratio–were examined alongside ML algorithms such as SVMs, RFs, KNN, LDA, and lightGBM, amongst others. ReliefF with an Extra-Tree demonstrated superior performance (classification accuracy of 99.94%) compared to state-of-the-art studies on the UI-PRMD (a 4.4% improvement). However, FCBF, alongside an Extra-Tree, demonstrated robust performance across diverse datasets, achieving 99.64% on UIPRMD (the second-best result) and 81.85% on KIMORE (the highest accuracy reported compared to state-of-the-art studies). FCBF attained robust results together with the various classifiers, averaging 92.65%.},
