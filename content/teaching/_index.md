      title: Teaching
      text: |
      Throughout my teaching career, I have had the opportunity to instruct more than ten courses, impacting the academic journeys of hundreds of university students. My teaching philosophy focuses on fostering a deep understanding of the subject matter, encouraging critical thinking, and promoting hands-on learning through innovative projects. I emphasize the use of visuals to enhance learning and understanding. Additionally, I believe in understanding the history behind every solution and always asking three key questions
      - What is the problem?
      - What are the possible solutions?
      - How can these solutions be implemented?
      Below is a list of some of the top projects developed by my students, reflecting the creativity, hard work, and dedication that they bring to their studies.
