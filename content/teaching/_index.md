      title: Teaching
      text: |
        Throughout my teaching career, I have had the opportunity to instruct more than 10 courses, impacting the academic journeys of hundreds of university students. My teaching philosophy focuses on fostering a deep understanding of the subject matter, encouraging critical thinking, and promoting hands-on learning through innovative projects. I emphasize the use of visuals to enhance learning and understanding. Additionally, I believe in understanding the history behind every solution and always asking three key questions:
          - What is the problem?
          - What are the possible solutions?
          - How can these solutions be implemented?
    
        Below is a list of the top courses I have taught, each designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary for their academic and professional growth.
