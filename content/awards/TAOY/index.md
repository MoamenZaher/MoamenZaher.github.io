<!-- I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully passed the Pre-defense seminar for my master's thesis. My thesis explores the application of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in the context of physical rehabilitation exercises, aiming to provide real-time feedback and assessment. Here are some key aspects of my research:

- **Objective**: The research investigates various machine learning and deep learning techniques, including transfer learning and attention models, to accurately recognize and evaluate physical movements. 🏋️‍♂️
- **Methodology**: By utilizing Kinect and RGB cameras, the study ensures accessibility and cost-effectiveness, making advanced rehabilitation technologies more widely available. 📷
- **Findings**: Through a comparative study of machine learning algorithms, a case study on a newly developed framework for assessing rehabilitation exercises, and an analysis of CNN and RNN algorithms across multiple datasets, the thesis offers comprehensive insights into the effectiveness of different approaches. 📊
- **Contributions**: Additionally, the work includes a study on transfer learning and model fusion techniques to enhance HAR performance. The results contribute to the advancement of real-time monitoring systems, providing valuable support for patients and healthcare professionals in the rehabilitation process. 🚀

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Assoc. Prof. [Ayman Ezzat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayman4/), Dr. [Amr Ghoniem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amrghoneim), and Dr. [Laila Abdelhamid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laila-abdelhamid-0714172b2/), for their guidance and support throughout this journey. The Pre-defense seminar was held at Helwan University - Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence (FCAI), located in Ain Helwan, Helwan, Cairo 11795. 🎓

My final master defense is expected to be held in July 2024, and I am looking forward to presenting my research findings and conclusions to the academic community. 📅 -->
