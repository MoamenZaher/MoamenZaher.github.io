I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully defended the my master's thesis. My thesis explores the application of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in the context of physical rehabilitation exercises, aiming to provide real-time feedback and assessment. Here are some key aspects of my research:

- **Objective**: The research investigates various machine learning and deep learning techniques, including transfer learning and attention models, to accurately recognize and evaluate physical movements. 🏋️‍♂️

- **Methodology**: By utilizing Kinect and RGB cameras, the study ensures accessibility and cost-effectiveness, making advanced rehabilitation technologies more widely available. 📷

- **Findings**: Through a comparative study of machine learning algorithms, a case study on a newly developed framework for assessing rehabilitation exercises, and an analysis of CNN and RNN algorithms across multiple datasets, the thesis offers comprehensive insights into the effectiveness of different approaches. 📊

- **Contributions**: Additionally, the work includes a study on transfer learning and model fusion techniques to enhance HAR performance. The results contribute to the advancement of real-time monitoring systems, providing valuable support for patients and healthcare professionals in the rehabilitation process. 🚀
