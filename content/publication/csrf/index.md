abstract: This paper investigates the application of utilizing machine learning techniques
  to enhance Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) detection in web applications. CSRF
  remains a critical security concern, consistently ranking among the top vulnerabilities
  in the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) list and Bugcrowd's ranking
  of global cybersecurity threats. We conduct a comparative analysis of sixteen machine
  learning algorithms, categorized as ensemble and non-ensemble methods. Our findings
  demonstrate that ensemble models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting and Extra
  Trees, achieve superior performance in identifying CSRF attacks compared to non-ensemble
  models. We evaluate the models using 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, consistently
  revealing the superiority of ensemble approaches. Notably, our proposed Extra Tree
  classifier surpasses the state-of-the-art Random Forest algorithm by 2.67% in recall
  and 1.16% in F1-score. These results highlight the potential of ensemble models
  for robust CSRF detection in web security.
