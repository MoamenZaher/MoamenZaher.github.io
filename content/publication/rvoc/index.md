abstract: System surveillance involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of organizational
  data to ensure security and operational efficiency. This proactive approach aids
  in detecting anomalies, threats, and performance issues, thereby safeguarding sensitive
  information and maintaining system integrity. This paper proposes a framework for
  querying videos named Referring Video Object Clustering (RVOC). Traditional methods
  necessitate identifying the number of clusters before object identification based
  on pre-trained datasets, with components such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  relying on fixed numerical values. In contrast, The proposed framework (RVOC) performs
  dynamic clustering without prior training, allowing the number of classes to adjust
  based on retrieved video objects. This method employs a sophisticated NLP query
  system, enabling intricate searches like “person skating on a red skateboard.” The
  system diligently searches and analyzes video content to find instances matching
  the query, grouping and segmenting detected individuals with advanced clustering
  algorithms. This enhances user experience by facilitating easy navigation and selection
  of desired individuals, with each cluster representing a unique person or object.
  RVOC's efficacy is evidenced by its Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score of
  51% in tests with multilabel car and color datasets.
