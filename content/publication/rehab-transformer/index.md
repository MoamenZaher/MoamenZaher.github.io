abstract: Physical therapy is crucial for recovering and enhancing the physical functions
  of patients. It also improves the recovery process after injuries, surgeries, or
  diseases. Home-based rehabilitation has become essential in healthcare, particularly
  due to the limitations of traditional rehabilitation methods. This study proposes
  a system for monitoring patients, tracking their progress throughout rehabilitation,
  and identifying the skeletal points for each exercise. Also, identifying exercises
  based on deep learning single models, transformer models, and fused models using
  datasets collected by an expert physiotherapist through RGB cameras. LSTM, CNN-GRU,
  CNN-LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM were applied with accuracies of 93.33%, 91.96%, 92.86%,
  93.33%, 91.11% respectively. DenseNet201 achieved a higher of 96.42% and ViT-CNN
  with 91.71%. Furthermore, the human activity recognition transformer (HART) achieved
  an accuracy score of 91.96%
