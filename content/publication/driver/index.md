abstract: Recognizing the importance of driver behavior is essential for enhancing
  road safety and optimizing traffic management systems. This study employs advanced
  deep learning techniques, specifically CNN-LSTM and Bi-LSTM models, to refine the
  prediction of driver behaviors using sensor data from the Honda Research Institute
  Driving Dataset (HDD). Our approach integrates a robust dataset encompassing a broad
  spectrum of sensor inputs, from vehicle dynamics to driver operational parameters,
  propelling advancements in driver behavior detection. The methodologies utilized
  enable the discernment of subtle and complex driving patterns, contributing to the
  reduction of road safety hazards. Our findings indicate that these models significantly
  improve the detection of hazardous driving behaviors, surpassing previous state-of-the-art
  methodologies with notable gains in mean average precision (mAP). These advancements
  affirm the potential of deep learning technologies in crafting sophisticated predictive
  safety systems, paving the way for future innovations.
