<!-- Project Description -->
## Overview
CSRF Attack Detection and Prevention Using ML is a project focused on enhancing web security by leveraging machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This project combines advanced data analysis and machine learning methodologies to develop a robust detection system and deployable API for real-time protection against CSRF threats.

CSRF attacks pose a significant threat to web applications by tricking users into executing unwanted actions on a different site where they are authenticated. This project aims to detect such attacks proactively and prevent potential security breaches through an intelligent, machine learning-based approach.

## Techniques and Implementation
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Applied various machine learning techniques, including supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
  - Conducted extensive experiments to compare the performance of these models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Selected the best-performing model for real-time CSRF attack detection based on evaluation metrics and computational efficiency.
- **Model Deployment**:
  - Developed an API to deploy the trained machine learning model, allowing integration with web applications for real-time CSRF attack detection and prevention.
  - Implemented the API using a FastAPI framework, ensuring it can handle high traffic and provide quick responses to incoming web requests.
- **Detection and Prevention Mechanism**:
  - The API monitors incoming web requests and analyzes them using the trained machine learning model.
- The project resulted into a conference publication.
