<!-- Project Description -->
## Project Overview
Scavenger Hunt is an interactive, game-based website designed to familiarize new students with the MSA University campus while promoting social interaction. The project splits newcomers into groups, referred to as "families," with teaching assistants serving as family leaders. This engaging approach helps students explore the campus, build connections, and integrate into the university community.

The primary goal of the Scavenger Hunt project is to create a fun and educational experience for new students at MSA University. By participating in a series of scavenger hunt challenges, students get to know the campus, its facilities, and each other, fostering a sense of community and belonging from the outset.

## Key Features

  - Points and Rewards: Participants earn points for completing tasks, with rewards and incentives to keep them motivated and engaged.
- **Group Dynamics**:
  - Family Groups: New students are divided into small groups called "families," encouraging teamwork and collaboration.
