      title: Projects under my supervision
      text: During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of co-supervising 5 graduation projects for a total of 8 students. These projects have culminated in seven conference publications, showcasing the innovative and impactful work done by our students. Below is a collection of some of the projects I contributed to as a co-supervisor, highlighting the diverse and interdisciplinary nature of our research. Additionally, you will find a side project developed for the university, designed as an engaging game for new students to help them integrate into the MSA University community.
