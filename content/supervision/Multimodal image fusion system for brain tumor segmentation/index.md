## Overview
Multimodal Image Fusion System for Brain Tumor Segmentation is a project dedicated to improving the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor classification and segmentation by utilizing various fusion techniques. This system integrates multiple imaging modalities to provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis, enhancing the overall diagnostic process.

The primary objective of this project is to classify brain tumors and accurately segment them using a combination of different fusion techniques, including early fusion, model fusion, and PCA-based fusion. The project employs advanced machine learning models, including CNN-based and attention-based models, alongside the U-Net architecture for precise tumor segmentation.

## Techniques and Implementation
- **Multimodal Image Fusion**:
  - Early Fusion: Combines multiple imaging modalities at the input level to create a richer and more informative dataset.
  - Model Fusion: Integrates the outputs of different models to leverage their strengths and improve classification accuracy.
  - PCA-Based Fusion: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and fuse features from multiple modalities effectively.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - CNN-Based Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for their strong performance in image classification tasks.
  - Attention-Based Models: These models focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, improving the accuracy and efficiency of tumor classification.
- **Tumor Segmentation**:
  - U-Net Architecture: A well-known architecture for medical image segmentation, U-Net is employed to precisely segment brain tumors from the fused images.

## Key Contributions
- - **Advanced Fusion Techniques**: The project explores multiple fusion techniques, combining the strengths of early fusion, model fusion, and PCA-based fusion to enhance classification and segmentation performance.

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: By integrating CNN-based and attention-based models, the system provides a robust and accurate analysis of brain tumors.

- **Precise Segmentation**: The use of U-Net architecture ensures high accuracy in tumor segmentation, which is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
