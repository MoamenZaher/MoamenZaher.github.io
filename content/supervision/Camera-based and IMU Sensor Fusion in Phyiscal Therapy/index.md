<!-- Project Description -->
## Overview


This interdisciplinary project conducted in collaboration with the Faculty of Physical Therapy at October University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA). This innovative project aims to fuse multimodal data from heterogeneous sensors to  monitor the execution of  rehabilitation exercises by integrating advanced technologies, including RGB-camera and pose estimation, computer vision, IMU sensos and deep learning, to improve the monitoriing of rhabilitation exercises.

In this project, we utilized a we purpose our own dataset validated by an expert physiotherpaist , facilitated by the faculty of physical therapy. The primary objective was to purpose a multimodal approach for rehabilitation tracking to overcome the challenge where one sensor may fail to capture the movement.


<!-- ## Techniques Employed
- **Pose Estimation**: Using Mediapipe framework to accurately track and analyze body movements during exercises in real-time with low-latency.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Implementing deep learning models to process and analyze the data collected from physical therapy sessions.

- **Signal Processing with Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)**: Converting signals into images to leverage the power of image-based deep learning models. This technique allowed us to apply transfer learning on pre-trained models effectively.

- **Vision Transformer and Time-Series Transformer**: Employing transformer models to handle both visual and temporal aspects of the data, providing more accurate and comprehensive analysis.

- **Few-Shot Learning**: Experimenting with few-shot learning techniques to improve the system's ability to generalize from a limited amount of data.

- **Augmented Reality Visualization**: Developing an AR environment to visualize a 3D skeleton performing the exercises. This approach ensures patient privacy by not displaying the actual doctor, while still providing clear and accurate guidance.
